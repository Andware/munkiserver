== Comments

- Right now, Munki environments do not mingle.  This means that if a computer is "Production" and a package is "Staging", you cannot assign the package to the computer.
- All packages start in the staging environment.
- After adding a computer object, you can download a ManagedInstalls.plist file that contains all the appropriate settings for that particular client.  Do to this, click on the "Computers" link and then click "Client Prefs" for the desired computer record.
- One user is made during deployment (`rake bootstrap:user`).  Username is 'default', password is 'password'.  Login with this user first.

Alpha Disclaimer: This version has been tested extremely minimally.  I'm sure there are a few quirks here and there.  This release is just to give a taste. :)
